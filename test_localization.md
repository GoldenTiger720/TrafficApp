# Testing Localization

## Test Steps

1. **Launch the app** - The app should start in English by default
2. **Navigate to Settings** - Tap the gear icon in the top right
3. **Find Language Setting** - Scroll to "Appearance" section, find "Language" dropdown
4. **Change to Russian** - Select "Русский" from dropdown
5. **Verify UI Updates** - All text should immediately change to Russian:
   - Settings → Настройки
   - Appearance → Внешний вид
   - Language → Язык
   - Theme → Тема
   - etc.
6. **Navigate back** - Go back to main screen
7. **Verify main screen** - Check that "Traffic Light Monitor" → "Монитор светофора"
8. **Test Polish** - Go back to settings and select "Polski"
9. **Verify Polish UI** - All text should change to Polish
10. **Restart app** - Close and reopen the app
11. **Verify persistence** - The app should still be in Polish

## What Was Fixed

1. **JSON Encoding Issue**: Fixed the settings provider to properly encode/decode JSON
2. **Error Handling**: Added graceful handling of corrupted data with automatic cleanup
3. **Localization Coverage**: Added translations for all UI elements in 3 languages

## How It Works

- Language preference is stored in SharedPreferences
- When language changes, the entire UI rebuilds with new locale
- All strings use `AppLocalizations.of(context)` for dynamic translation
- Fallback to English if translation is missing
